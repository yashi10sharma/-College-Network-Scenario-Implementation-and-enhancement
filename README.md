# -College-Network-Scenario-Implementation-and-enhancement
##### This is our final year Graduation project

### Abstract
Network is basically set of devices or nodes connected by communication links, where the nodes can be computer, printer, or any device capable of sending and receiving data and the link can be wired or wireless. In this paper we are focusing on wired network. College Network Scenario means the wired network of a college through which communication of various departments are handled. The audience for this project can be any college who needs to setup advanced and idol network structure in their premises or even some offices or building networks can be handled similarly.  

### Inroduction
College Network Scenario Implementation and Enhancement is a networking based project .Where we study the present network scenario of our college and find out the best suited topology for our college network.
For the Implementation part we are using:-
* •	Cisco Packet Tracer 
* •	 Mininet
For the enhancement we are working on two network criteria:-
* •	Network Performance
* •	Network Security

CNS Stands for the college network scenario. This basically deals with the designing a topology of a network that is a LAN (Local Area Network) for a College in which various computers of different departments are set up so that they can interact and communicate with each other by interchanging data. To design a networking scenario for a college which connects various departments to each other’s, it puts forward communication among different departments. CNS is used to design a systematic and well planned topology, satisfying all the necessities of the college (i.e. client). CNS comes up with a network with good performance. CNS is also providing security and authentication to forbid unauthorized logins

The network performance of any network depends on –
* •	Types of hardware and software used
* •	Number of users connected on the network
* •	Type of medium used

The network performance can be measured in terms of transit time and response time.
* Transit Time – is the time elapsed by sending message between sender and receiver
* Response Time – is the time between inquiry and response
Working on the basis of these facts, we are setting up our college network scenario into various topologies so as to get the best suited one i.e. once we get a topology which takes minimum time in transferring data across nodes we will work using that topology in simulator as well as practically in labs. The topology thus found will be suggested to our college for implementation.
